CHAEN COLLECTIVE empowers users in the efficient management of investment clubs, opening up access to participation in investment funds. Operating on a decentralized and agile platform, it offers various functionalities for individuals involved in these investment clubs:

Club Creation:

Effortless Establishment: Users can seamlessly create investment clubs by defining a name, associating it with the account of the creator (owner).

Membership Management:

Inclusive Participation: Available to all aeternity blockchain account holders, individuals can effortlessly join or leave existing investment clubs with just a few clicks.

Contributions to the Pool:

Collaborative Funding: Members of a club can contribute to a common fund (pool) by depositing AE coins, fostering a shared financial resource for investment proposals.

Proposal Creation and Voting:

Informed Decision-Making: Club members who have contributed to the pool can propose investments, providing details such as description, amount (within pool limits), and recipient. Every member has the authority to approve or reject proposals, with each member having a single vote.

Proposal Execution:

Transparent Operations: Proposal owners, having secured approval surpassing rejection, can execute the proposal. This leads to the transfer of the designated amount to the specified recipient. Owners also retain the option to close proposals, whether due to cancellation, publication errors, or to prevent fund disbursement.

In essence, CHAEN COLLECTIVE forms a dynamic ecosystem fostering financial collaboration, enabling users to effectively manage investment activities while embracing decentralization and flexibility.
